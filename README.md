# Serverless Aurora with Data API

This template shows the basic setup to deploy a stack with serverless Aurora on AWS. Featuring:

- Data API to remove the need for Lambda VPC configuration.
- [data-api-client](https://github.com/jeremydaly/data-api-client) to abstract away the verbosity of using the Data API directly.
- Secrets Manager to manage Aurora credentials, using _autogenerated_ password.
- TypeScript

### Things to Note:

- The types for `data-api-client` shown in `custom.d.ts` are incomplete, and based off an [open PR](https://github.com/jeremydaly/data-api-client/pull/49).
- The resulting endpoints are not protected. There are other resources out there showing how to add auth to serverless endpoints.
- No offline support for the database.
